----> x86 Registers

-> Registers are volatile. They are the fastest
memory available to the CPU, on the CPU die itself.

-> The CPU reads data from other memories, performs
calculations in its registers, adn writes the results
back to the other memory. The other memory areas
basically only allow reading and writing. All computation
is performed with registers.
